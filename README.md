TYPES OF HOSTING
- Shared Hosting
- VPS Hosting
- Dedicated Server
- Reseller Hosting
- Cloud Hosting
- Static Hosting

SHARED HOSTING
Shared hosting allows multiple websites to utilize a single server. Usually, you’ll have no idea who or what websites you’re sharing the resources of a server with. Each customer will usually have a limit on the total amount of server resources they can use, but this will be defined by your hosting package.
- One account of many on a server(same environment)
- Cheapest(aside from free static hosting)
- Used for small websites
- Most include email, FTP, PHP, databases, software
- $3 to $15 per month

VPS(Virtual Private Server)
In layman’s terms, a server is a powerful computer that stores all of the data and files that make up your website. When someone types your domain name into their web browser, that powerful computer “serves up” your website to the searcher’s screen.

Now for the virtual aspect: VPS uses virtualization technology to split that one powerful server we just talked about into multiple virtual servers. Think of it this way: it’s one piece of physical hardware that functions like several separate servers.

The word private means just what it implies. Your virtual server is reserved for you, so you won’t have to share RAM, CPU, or any data with other users.
-Your own virtualized server
- Can create multiple shared accounts
- More access & priviledges
- Everything Shared hosting offers
- $20 to $100 per month

RESELLER HOSTING
Reseller Hosting in simple terms can be said to be a hosting service where you, the reseller, rent out your services to your customers, in turn, earning a profit. These web hosting services include server bandwidth, CPU, disk space, RAM, etc. You can have 10, 50 or any number of customers depending on how much server space and resources you have purchased.
- Create & manage multiple shared accounts
- Can sell shared accounts to your own customers
- Very similar to a VPS
- Usually comes with reseller software
- $15 to $100 per month

DEDICATED SERVER
Dedicated hosting essentially means that your website has its own server all to itself. It offers immense power and flexibility, but usually comes at a premium. As such, it’s important to do your research before opting to purchase this type of plan.
- Your own actual server
- You rent out a physical machine
- Full access & priviledges
- Harder to manage but very powerful
- $100 to $400 per month

CLOUD HOSTING
Cloud hosting makes applications and websites accessible using cloud resources. Unlike traditional hosting, solutions are not deployed on a single server. Instead, a network of connected virtual and physical cloud servers hosts the application or website, ensuring greater flexibility and scalability.
 

Key features:

Applications and solutions are deployed on a cloud network rather than an on-premises, single server.
Resources scale to user needs.
Organizations only pay for the resources they use.
Cloud hosting can support SQL (including MySQL) or NoSQL databases.
Solutions are automated and controlled using APIs, web portals, and mobile apps.
- Used for web apps
- Multiple servers work together
- very scalable and great for large apps
- Not for beginners/ harder to manage
- Pay as You Go

STATIC HOSTING
- Does not come with bells and whistles of managed hosting
- Upload static site via git
- Free, but pay for extra features
